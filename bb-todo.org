*** DONE Task system
At this point I think I can keep it to just tasks and projects on this end.
Any reporting stuff might need models to send down server-side calculations,
but most likely it will be simple enough to do on the client.

**** DONE Tasks

**** DONE Projects

*** TODO Network Communication Models
Simple model for json serialization. The base models themselves are simple enough to just use.
Versioning might be an issue, but that might be over-complicating things.
